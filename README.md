# 30-Day JavaScript Challenge ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to my 30-Day JavaScript Challenge repository! Over the next month, I'll be diving into daily coding challenges and projects to enhance my JavaScript skills under the guidance of Hitesh Sir.

## Purpose
This repository documents my daily progress and solutions to JavaScript challenges. Each day, I'll tackle new exercises to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript concepts, from basics to advanced topics.



## How to Use
Feel free to explore the challenges, review my code, and provide feedback or suggestions. If you're also on a JavaScript learning journey, perhaps this repository can inspire and help you too!

## Resources
- The challenges are guided by Hitesh Sir's course materials and exercises.
